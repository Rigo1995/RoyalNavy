        The Rise
    </h1>
    <p>
        From the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch
        Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most
        powerful navy until surpassed by the United States Navy during the Second World War. The Royal Navy played a
        key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the
        20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as "the
        Royal Navy" without qualification.
