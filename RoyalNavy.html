        <h1> The Rise </h1>
        <p>
            From the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the
            Dutch
            Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the
            world's
            most
            powerful navy until surpassed by the United States Navy during the Second World War. The Royal Navy
            played
            a
            key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part
            of
            the
            20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it
            as
            "the
            Royal Navy" without qualification.
