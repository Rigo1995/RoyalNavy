            From the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the
            Dutch
            Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the
            world's
            most
            powerful navy until surpassed by the United States Navy during the Second World War. The Royal Navy
            played
            a
            key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part
            of
            the
            20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it
            as
            "the
            Royal Navy" without qualification.

    <p>The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English
        kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War
        against the Kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest
        of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.</p>
